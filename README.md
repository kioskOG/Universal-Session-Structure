# 💡 DevSecOps Production Masterclass Series

Welcome to the **DevSecOps Production Masterclass Series** — a comprehensive knowledge-sharing initiative designed to equip developers, architects, and operations engineers with **practical, production-ready design skills**.

This series is *not* about tools alone. Instead, it's a complete roadmap to understanding **how real-world, cloud-native, secure, and observable production systems are designed, built, and scaled** from Day 1 to Day Infinity.

Whether you're modernizing a monolith, building a greenfield platform, or evolving an SRE team — this series is your **real-world production companion**.

### 1. 🌩️ Cloud Design

* Multi-account setup (AWS Organizations, Landing Zones)
* VPC Design: public/private subnets, NAT gateways
* IAM Strategy (RBAC, permission boundaries, audit readiness)
* Choosing the right services: ECS, EKS, Lambda, S3
* Multi-region architectures (HA vs DR)
* Billing segmentation, tagging, and cost allocation
* Cloud security controls and threat models

➡️ **[View Session →](#)**

### 2. 🌐 Network Design

* VPC Peering, PrivateLink, Transit Gateway
* VPN, Direct Connect: hybrid cloud topologies
* Internal/external DNS design (Route 53, CoreDNS)
* Network ACLs, security groups, firewall strategy
* Zero Trust network design & microsegmentation
* Service mesh: when and why

* Feature flags, toggles, and A/B testing
* API Gateway + Service Mesh integration strategies

➡️ **[View Session →](#)**

---

### 6. 🔭 Observability

* Centralized logs, metrics, tracing: unified strategy
* Observability stack: Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Tempo
* SLOs, SLIs, SLAs: measuring what matters
* Alert fatigue management and routing best practices
* Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry
* Correlating logs with incidents in real-time

### 7. 📈 Scaling

* App scaling: Horizontal, vertical, and beyond
* Asynchronous processing & event-driven design
* DB scaling: read replicas, partitioning, sharding
* Caching layers (Redis, CDN, application-level)
* Cost-aware scaling: spot instances, limits, quotas
* Org scaling: platform teams, internal developer platforms
