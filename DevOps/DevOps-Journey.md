        This document outlines a comprehensive, phased plan for a DevSecOps masterclass, simulating the journey of building and scaling a product for a client from scratch. It builds on the provided reference, completing the structure with logical progressions for Phases 3-10. Each phase includes **To-DO** tasks, **Outcome** goals, and **Next** steps to guide the course flow. The plan emphasizes practical, hands-on learning, evolving from basic setups to enterprise-level DevSecOps practices using AWS, EKS, Terraform, and other tools.
        The course assumes a sample application with 5 microservices + MySQL, starting from a Docker Compose file. Phases progress iteratively, addressing client expectations like cost-effectiveness, monitoring, and scalability.

## Overall Course Objectives

- Simulate real-world DevSecOps evolution for a new client project.
- Cover key pillars: Cloud Design, Network Design, Infrastructure Provisioning, CI/CD, Application Architecture, Microservices, Observability, HA/Scaling/Resiliency/Rollouts/Rollbacks, and Troubleshooting.
- Focus on mindset: Iterative problem-solving, cost optimization, and security-by-design.
- Tools: AWS, EKS/ECS, Terraform, GitHub Actions/Jenkins, Prometheus/Grafana, etc.
- Duration: 10 phases, scalable to 10-20 sessions.


## Phase 1: Initial Client Onboarding and Infra Design

**To-DO**:

- Introduce the scenario: New client project starting from scratch.
- Show application flow as a diagram depicting 5 applications (e.g., frontend, auth service, payment service, user service, inventory service) + MySQL database, illustrating interactions (e.g., API calls, DB queries).
- Review Docker Compose file shared by the client for local setup.
- Discuss client expectations:
    - Choosing Cloud to run application (AWS for its ecosystem and cost tools).
    - Choosing Virtual Machine or Container as application orchestrator (Opt for containers via EKS for scalability over VMs).
    - Setting up Monitoring/Alerting (Basic Prometheus/Grafana).
    - Setup infra in most cost-effective way (Use spot instances, right-sizing, auto-scaling).
- Initial level Infra design:
    - Basic Cloud design: AWS with single-account setup, focusing on core services (EC2/EKS, RDS for MySQL).
    - Networking Design - What/Why: VPC with public/private subnets for isolation (why: security and cost control); Networking Schema (diagram with subnets, IGW, NAT); Single AZ initially for cost, plan for Multi-AZ later.
    - Virtual Machine or Container: Choose EKS for container orchestration (why: better for microservices scaling than raw VMs).

**Outcome**:

- Convey client expectations and align on priorities.
- Create or show:
    - Application flow diagram shared by client.
    - Proposed infra design by DevOps (diagram including AWS components, networking, EKS).

- Create the infra in front of the audience:
    - Creating VPC Networking (subnets, security groups).
    - Creating EKS cluster.
    - Creating ECR (Elastic Container Registry) for image storage.
- Deploy applications in EKS manually (push images to ECR, apply Kubernetes manifests).
