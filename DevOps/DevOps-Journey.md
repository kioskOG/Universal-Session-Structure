# DevSecOps Course Plan Canvas

This document outlines a comprehensive, phased plan for a DevSecOps masterclass, simulating the journey of building and scaling a product for a client from scratch. It builds on the provided reference, completing the structure with logical progressions for Phases 3-10. Each phase includes **To-DO** tasks, **Outcome** goals, and **Next** steps to guide the course flow. The plan emphasizes practical, hands-on learning, evolving from basic setups to enterprise-level DevSecOps practices using AWS, EKS, Terraform, and other tools.

The course assumes a sample application with 5 microservices + MySQL, starting from a Docker Compose file. Phases progress iteratively, addressing client expectations like cost-effectiveness, monitoring, and scalability.

## Overall Course Objectives

- Simulate real-world DevSecOps evolution for a new client project.
- Cover key pillars: Cloud Design, Network Design, Infrastructure Provisioning, CI/CD, Application Architecture, Microservices, Observability, HA/Scaling/Resiliency/Rollouts/Rollbacks, and Troubleshooting.
- Focus on mindset: Iterative problem-solving, cost optimization, and security-by-design.
- Tools: AWS, EKS/ECS, Terraform, GitHub Actions/Jenkins, Prometheus/Grafana, etc.
- Duration: 10 phases, scalable to 10-20 sessions.


## Phase 1: Initial Client Onboarding and Infra Design

**To-DO**:

- Introduce the scenario: New client project starting from scratch.
- Show application flow as a diagram depicting 5 applications (e.g., frontend, auth service, payment service, user service, inventory service) + MySQL database, illustrating interactions (e.g., API calls, DB queries).
- Review Docker Compose file shared by the client for local setup.
- Discuss client expectations:
    - Choosing Cloud to run application (AWS for its ecosystem and cost tools).
    - Choosing Virtual Machine or Container as application orchestrator (Opt for containers via EKS for scalability over VMs).
    - Setting up Monitoring/Alerting (Basic Prometheus/Grafana).
    - Setup infra in most cost-effective way (Use spot instances, right-sizing, auto-scaling).
- Initial level Infra design:
    - Basic Cloud design: AWS with single-account setup, focusing on core services (EC2/EKS, RDS for MySQL).
    - Networking Design - What/Why: VPC with public/private subnets for isolation (why: security and cost control); Networking Schema (diagram with subnets, IGW, NAT); Single AZ initially for cost, plan for Multi-AZ later.
    - Virtual Machine or Container: Choose EKS for container orchestration (why: better for microservices scaling than raw VMs).

**Outcome**:

- Convey client expectations and align on priorities.
- Create or show:
    - Application flow diagram shared by client.
    - Proposed infra design by DevOps (diagram including AWS components, networking, EKS).
    - Explanation of the entire Application/Infra diagram with networking concepts (e.g., subnets for traffic segregation).
- Decide on Cloud (AWS) and Container Orchestrator (EKS).

**Next**:

- Running application locally using Docker Compose to check the flow as communicated by Client.
- IaC design discussion.
- CI/CD tool and design discussion.
- Infra deployment with working application deployed MANUALLY in EKS.


## Phase 2: Dev Environment Setup

**To-DO**:

- Run Docker Compose file locally to check if all services (5 apps + MySQL) are working as expected (verify API flows, DB connections).
- Decide what Infra as Code tool to use - Discussion around options (Terraform vs. Pulumi; choose Terraform for maturity and community support).
- Terraform Project Structure:
    - Dev: Separate module for development environment.
    - Prod: Separate module for production with stricter controls.
- CI/CD Tool selection and design (e.g., GitHub Actions for simplicity; design pipeline for build/deploy).
- Create the infra in front of the audience:
    - Creating VPC Networking (subnets, security groups).
    - Creating EKS cluster.
    - Creating ECR (Elastic Container Registry) for image storage.
- Deploy applications in EKS manually (push images to ECR, apply Kubernetes manifests).
- Run/show application via kube port-forward proxy for local access.

**Outcome**:

- Participants gain basic design idea of Terraform, understanding how multiple projects (dev/prod) would be managed (e.g., modular code for reusability).
- Show working app demo running via kube port proxy, demonstrating end-to-end flow.

**Next**:

- Add replicas for high availability in the cluster.
- Introduce basic scaling and resiliency checks.


## Phase 3: Adding Replicas for High Availability

**To-DO**:

- Update Kubernetes deployments to add replicas (e.g., 2-3 pods per service for the 5 apps and MySQL).
- Configure Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) in EKS for automatic scaling based on CPU/metrics.
- Test failover scenarios (e.g., kill a pod and observe recovery).
- Update networking to support replicas (e.g., service load balancing in Kubernetes).
- Discuss trade-offs: Cost vs. reliability in single vs. multi-AZ.

**Outcome**:

- Demonstrate improved resiliency with replicas, showing how the system handles failures without downtime.
- Participants understand HA basics in containerized environments, including pod distribution across nodes.

**Next**:

- Integrate Redis for caching to optimize performance and reduce DB load.


## Phase 4: Integrating Redis for Caching

**To-DO**:

- Add Redis as a caching layer (e.g., deploy as a Kubernetes service, integrate with apps for session storage/query caching).
- Update application code/config to use Redis (e.g., cache frequent MySQL queries).
- Configure Redis replicas for HA and persistence.
- Update Terraform to provision managed Redis (e.g., AWS ElastiCache) in dev/prod.
- Test cache invalidation and performance improvements.

**Outcome**:

- Show how caching reduces latency and DB load, with metrics before/after integration.
- Learners grasp caching strategies in microservices, including consistency challenges.

**Next**:

- Automate deployments with CI/CD pipelines for efficient rollouts.


## Phase 5: Automating CI/CD Pipelines

**To-DO**:

- Design and implement CI/CD using chosen tool (e.g., GitHub Actions): Build Docker images, push to ECR, deploy to EKS via Helm/Kustomize.
